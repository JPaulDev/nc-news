<h1 align="center">Northcoders News</h1>

The website has a homepage that displays the latest news articles, which can be
sorted by date, comments or likes. Users can also filter articles by a specific
topic they are interested in. Each news article has its own page, which includes
a featured image, the article title, author name, date of publication, and the
article content. The article page also allows users to leave comments and share
their thoughts. The project utilises the news API found here: https://github.com/JPaulDev/news-api
